- Most stablecoin designs use an oracle to bring in data of the exchange rate of assets, in order to peg their value to a real world currency
- Synthetic assets use oracles as price feeds in order to determine if the underlying cryptocurrency sufficiently collateralizes the debt position.
- Prediction markets use oracles to decide the outcome of real world events and determine the payout of the prediction shares.
