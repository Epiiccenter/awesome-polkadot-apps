## On Parachain

## On Native Parachain
- A blockchain can interact with Polkadot in two main ways: as a native parachain and through a bridge parachain. 
- To deploy as a native parachain a team could build using the Cumulus framework (based on Substrate),
- Another approach is to develop from scratch or use one of the upcoming Parachain Development Kits.
- Native parachains can make use of faster inter-chain messaging and Polkadot’s shared security. 

## On Bridge Parachain
- if a blockchain has a set of legacy design decisions that makes it difficult to move under Polkadot wholesale,
- it can retain its own consensus and finality mechanism and connect via a bridge hosted on a parachain to become a “bridge chain”.
